# HOW TO HOST AND FORMAT A RESUME USING MARKDOWN, A MARKDOWN EDITOR, GITHUB PAGES AND JEKYLL.
## Purpose
This documents explains the practical steps of how to host and format a resume using Markdown, a Markdown editor, GitHub Pages and Jekyll. On the other hand, it relates the practical steps to the general principles of current Technical writing, as explained in Andrew Etter's book _Modern Technical Writing._
## Prerequisites 
First of all, i will start by explaining what each of these documentation tools are: Markdown, Markdown editor, GitHub Pages and Jekyll. We will then need a a resume formatted in Markdown.
### Markdown 
Markdown is a light markup language that allows you to write easy to read content. It is often used to write README files like this; i used markdown as well. A Markdown editor helps you to preview and convert your text written into HTML directly. You can learn more about this [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/grav/grav_markdown_syntax.htm).
### GitHub 
GitHub is a platform that enables software developers solve problems by working together and is an example of a Distributed Version Control System(DVCS). Software developers can work on projects offline by downloading projects from GitHub. Once they are done, they submit the changes onto GitHub where another member can pull the same code and work on it. Afterwards, they can also merge both code segments on GitHub.
This prevents developers from overwriting each other's work. GitHub pages is a service provided by GitHub to host static websites from files straight from their projects on GitHub. You can learn more about GitHub and GitHub Pages [here](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/).
### Jekyll
Jekyll is a static site generator as well that takes text written in markup languages and uses layouts to create appealing static websites. GitHub Pages provides Jekyll layout templates that can be chosen to publish to add on to your static website. I have used GitHub Pages and Jekyll templates to host my resume. You can learn more about Jekyll [here](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/home/).
### Resume formatted in markdown
A resume is a document created to present a person's accomplishments and background usually written to a target audience. Using Markdown will catch the reader's eye. Moreover, you can take advantage of the format and include GIFs for each of your project. As per Etter's book [Modern Technical Writing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28433138-modern-technical-writing) you will save the hustle of printing and reduce paper waste too since most employers accept resumes hosted on static websites.

## How do i start writing my resume?
This is a really great questions that can be answered with [Etter's book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28433138-modern-technical-writing). First of all, start by defining your audience. Below are instructions practical steps on how to create a resume:
### Audience
1. Identify what the employer is looking for. 
2. Make sure to conduct research to indentify how your knowledge and skills align with the opportunity. 
3. Higlight your skills and include only specific information relevant to the opportunity.
### Style
1. Make sure you are consistent in your writing for examples using the same abbreviations for a word being mentioned multiple times.
2. Including headers and bullets which makes easier for the employer to scan through.
### Use markup language
1. Makes your document is easy to read and appealing to the eye.
2. Publish a static website with it and update it anytime online.
### Use Distributed Version Control System(DVCS)
1. Use GitHub to help yourself learn from others, get help from other and let others learn from you.
### Divide information into fragments
1. Make sure to group your work into topics and subtopics which will make your work easier when you want to update your work. You will only have to change a small part of your work hence avoiding duplicating.
