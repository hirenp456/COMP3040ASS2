# HOW TO HOST AND FORMAT A RESUME USING MARKDOWN, A MARKDOWN EDITOR, GITHUB PAGES AND JEKYLL.
## Purpose
This documents explains the practical steps of how to host and format a resume using Markdown, a Markdown editor, GitHub Pages and Jekyll. On the other hand, it relates the practical steps to the general principles of current Technical writing, as explained in Andrew Etter's book _Modern Technical Writing._
## Prerequisites 
First of all, i will start by explaining what each of these documentation tools are: Markdown, Markdown editor, GitHub Pages and Jekyll.
### Markdown 
Markdown is a light markup language that allows you to write easy to read content. It is often used to write README files like this; i used markdown as well. A Markdown editor helps you to preview and convert your text written into HTML directly. 
### GitHub 
GitHub is a platform that enables software developers solve problems by working together. Software developers can work on projects offline by downloading projects from GitHub. Once they are done, they submit the changes onto GitHub where another member can pull the same code and work on it. Afterwards, they can also merge both code segments on GitHub.
This prevents developers from overwriting each other's work. GitHub pages is a service provided by GitHub to host static websites from files straight from their projects on GitHub. 
### Jekyll
Jekyll is a static site generator as well that takes text written in markup languages and uses layouts to create appealing static websites. GitHub Pages provides Jekyll layout templates that can be chosen to publish to add on to your static website. I have used GitHub Pages and Jekyll templates to host my resume.
